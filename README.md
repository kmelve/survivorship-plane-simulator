# Survivorship Bias Plane Simulator

A satirical web game that demonstrates survivorship bias through interactive WWII airplane armor analysis, complete with overconfident VC advisor commentary.

## What is Survivorship Bias?

During WWII, the military wanted to add armor to planes but had limited weight capacity. They analyzed returning damaged aircraft to see where to place armor. The obvious choice? Armor the areas with the most bullet holes.

**But statistician Abraham Wald had a crucial insight**: The bullet holes showed where a plane *could* be hit and *still return*. The planes hit in other areas never came back to be analyzed.

This is **survivorship bias** - drawing conclusions from "successful" examples while ignoring the failures that didn't make it into your dataset.

## The Game Experience

### üéØ Educational Gameplay

## The Real-World Lesson

This game demonstrates a cognitive bias that affects:

- **Startups** - "Just copy successful companies!" (ignoring the failed ones)
- **Investing** - Focusing on unicorn success stories 
- **Product Development** - Only analyzing successful features
- **Career Advice** - "Do what successful people did!" 
- **Medical Research** - Studying survivors while missing critical failure cases

The lesson? **Always ask: "What am I not seeing? Where's the missing data?"**

## Historical Context

Abraham Wald's insight saved countless lives by armoring the *right* parts of aircraft. His work at the Statistical Research Group during WWII exemplifies how mathematical thinking can reveal counterintuitive truths.

The planes that came back shot full of holes represented the areas where you *didn't* need extra armor. The areas with few holes were the critical spots - because planes hit there didn't return to tell the tale.
